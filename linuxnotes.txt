Notes on linux

 Unix is base version of operating system
Linux is version of unix operating system

Characteristics:
--------------------------------------
It is freeware software---no cost for license
It is opensource software--Source code is open to modify as per your need
It is multiuser operating system
It is multitasking operating system
Supports both cui and gui base----cui-command user interface--Example Ubuntu
Most powerfull is cui

      How you can create multiple directoris in one click??
      -----mkdir dir{1..50}

      How you can create multiple files in multiple directories?
      -----touch dir{1..50}/file{1..100}

It is more secure than windows OS

Flavours of Unix:
------------------
RedHat Linux
Ubuntu
Centos
Fedora
Slackware
Open
Open Solaris
Kali
Suse Linux Enterprise server
Open Suse

Note:distrowatch.com-------------This website provides multiple flavours on Linux


Components of UNIX:
------------------
Shell
Kernel

1. Shell
-------------
It is outer layer of OS
Shell reads command provided by user
Shell will check it is valid command or not
Shell will check it is properly used command or not
If everything is ok shell will interprete/convert that command into kernel understandable format and handover it to kernel
It acts as interface between user and kernel

2. Kernel
It will execute command and gives result with help of hardware 
It is core of OS
It is responsible for memory allocation and processor allocation
It acts as interface between shell and hardware


To do big things:
Combination of multiple command
--------
-----------
----
------
----
-------------This is called script which is shell script



Command Execution flow:
-----------------------
User will type command
Shell will read and covert for kernel
Kernel gives result

Two types of Users:
-------------------
Normal user------$
Super user-------#


sudo -i ==> To switch to superuser


***For practice linux
Online UNIX terminal: http://www.masswerk.at/jsuix



The most commonly used commands:
---------------------------------
1. pwd---> present working diretory
2. ls----> list out all files in directory
3. mkdir----> To make a directory
4. cd---> change directory
5. touch---> create new file
6. cal----> Display the current month calender
7. date---> Display current date and time
8. help---> To display list of available
9. clear--> To clear terminal
10. exit--> To logout session
11. hello--> To display in brief system information


Users get created in home directory of root----
----For example if deepak user is there, then it's path is /home/guest/deepak



****In Linux once file deleted then it can not be recover....hence take care while using linux 'rm' command



Linux File System:
-------------------
Types of files in linux:
------------------------
In Python everything is treated as object.
In Linux everythhing is treated as file.

Files in Linux OS divided into three types:
1. Normal files/odinary files
2. Directory files
3. Device files


1. Normal file:
------------------
These files contain data. It can be normal  text file or binary file--Images,audio and Videos.

abc.txt
test.sh
test.py
sunny.jpg
bahubali.mp4

*******In linux the file extension is not important. Linux can identified it based on content*******


2. Directory files:
-----------------
In linux these files represent directory.
Directory also treated as files.


3. Device files:
------------------
In linux every device is represented as file.
By using these files we can communicate with that device or drivers.
Inside /dev directory all device related files are there.

terminal is a device which can also be consider file..

terminal 1 ==> /dev/pts/0
terminal 2 ==> /dev/pts/1

For example you want to send Hello Termial1 mg to other terminal then..
===>  $ echo 'Hello Terminal2' > /dev/pts/1


Note:
ctrl+alt+t ==> To open terminal
ctrl+d ==> To close the terminal 


How to check file type:
------------------------
In ubuntu blue color files represents: Directories and remaining are ordinary files.
Dont depend on color conventions....

We have to use ls command with -l option. 
-l mens long listing.
After running above command u will see details with number of column. 

>>In first column seee first symbol.This symbol represent type of file.
>>If it is - then it is file
>>If it is d then it is directory file
>>If it is l then it is link file


File system navigation commands:
---------------------------------

Hidden files and directory

ls -a === -a is all

There are two types of hidden file .(Single dot) and ..(Double dot) 
. ==> Single dot means current directory
.. ==> Double dot means parent directory


-----cd..==>o to parent directory
-----cd ../../..===> To go to previous to precvious directory

----In linux if there are multiple users then these users are created in home directory.

User home directory represented by symbol ~
hence if we type 'cd ~' we will go in user home directory.
If you used only 'cd' command you will go to user home directory and not in root directory
If you want to go to previous working directory  use cd - command
If you want directly go to home directory use command 'cd /home'



***Linux File system heirarchy***
--------------------------------------
Linux file system is tree like structure
/ is topmost directory
Sub directories: bin  etc  lib   dev  usr  cdrom

1. bin directory:
-------------------
bin means binary
In bin directory all binary executable files relate to our linux command.
Example: If you type 'which ls' command you will get output= bin/ls
Hence ls or mkdir such type of commands are from bin folder

2. sbin directory:
---------------------
sbin means system bin.
Noraml user related command are in bin 
Super user uses special commands contain in sbin


3. etc directory:
----------------------
All system configuration files included in etc folder
If you provided passward in cetain case then such type of information is available in etc folder
/etc/passwd ===> All users information
/etc/group ===> All groups information is avaiable
/etc/hosts ===> IP adress or DNS name such type of information about hhost machine is available

Need of virtual box:
-----------------------
To run multiple virtual computers on a platform that platform is vitual box

The default shell used in all Linux distributions is the GNU bash shell.The GNU bash shell is a program that provides interactive access to the linux system. It runs as a regular program, normally started whenever a user logs in to a terminal. The shell that the system starts depends on your user ID configuration. 

The /etc/passwd file contains a list of all the system user accounts, along with some basic configuration information about each user. Here’s a sample entry from a /etc/passwd file "vitthal:x:501:501:Rich Blum:/home/vitthal:/bin/bash"

The prompt is your gateway to the shell. The default prompt symbol for the bash shell is the dollar sign ($).
To create a new prompt, just assign a new string to the PS1 variable:
[rich@testbox ~]$ PS1="[\t][\u]\$"
[14:40:32][rich]$
